As we all know that the world is fighting Covid-19 pandemic, we are here to design and develop a parking solution for colleges and schools. There is a crucial problem of vehicle parking in these areas. The vehicle parking area has many lanes/slots for car parking. So to park a vehicle one has to look for all the lanes. Moreover this involves a lot of manual labour and investment. Instead of vehicle caught in towing the vehicle can park on safe and security with low cost.

The objective of this project is to build a Vehicle Parking management system without any sensors that enables the time management and control of vehicles by scanning QR code of user .The system that will track the entry and exit of vehicles, maintain a listing of vehicles within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not and it will will automatically show the nearsest available parking spot for the convenience of the user without any human contact.
